Born in the troubled city
In Rock and Roll, USA
In the shadow of the tallest building
I vowed I would break away
Listened to the Sunday actors
But all the would ever say

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away 
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Schooled on the city sidewalks
Coldness at every turn
Knew I had to find the exits
I never, ever would return
Scoffed at the prophet's omens
That said I would live to learn

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
