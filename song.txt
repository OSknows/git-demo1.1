Born in the troubled city
In Rock and Roll, USA
In the shadow of the tallest building
I vowed I would break away
Listened to the Sunday actors
But all the would ever say

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away 
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Schooled on the city sidewalks
Coldness at every turn
Knew I had to find the exits
I never, ever would return
Scoffed at the prophet's omens
That said I would live to learn

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Going unaided toward the west coat
Stopped in the sleepy town
Left my change and walked out
I didn't even turn around
Was that old familiar sound

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

In a hotel room in Amsterdam
On a wild and windy August night
As a cloud passed over a cold moon
My heart was seized with terror and fright
Seeping up through floorboards
Comming in through the walls
Coming in through the doorway
Rinning up and down the halss

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away
No you can't get away
No you can't get away...
